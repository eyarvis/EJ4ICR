# EJ4ICR

Summer 2023 Project for ICR.

This repo was created with the intent to compare the correlation between enviormental justice indexes and demographic indexes across the US. Included in this REPO is a csv table 'totalTracts.csv' that contains the demographic and enviormental indexes for every single tract in the united states. Also included is various heatmaps and plots that compare these demographic and enviormental indexes to one another as well as displaying their correlation.

The file EJRP.py contains my intital research and findings on the first 15 tracts I tested(5 tracts from 3 different cities: Portland, Houston, and Detroit).
